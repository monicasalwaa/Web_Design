# **D’Monique Store**  
*SMEs website project using HTML, CSS, PHP, &amp; SQL —  (Jan 2023)*

D'Monique Store is a cake shop website project built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. HTML is used for the basic structure of web pages, while CSS is used for page styling and layout. PHP is used to manage business logic such as user authentication, order management and more. SQL is used for interactions with databases, such as storing user details, cake product details, and order information. Users can view different types of cakes, add cakes to their shopping cart, and make payments. All this data is stored and managed in a SQL database. Thus, this project covers both front-end and back-end aspects of web development.
